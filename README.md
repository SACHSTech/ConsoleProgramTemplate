## Running Your Code in VS Code
To run your code, hit the F5 function key on your keyboard (you may need to hit fn + F5, depending on your keyboard configuration).  On the command prompt at the top that appears, enter the name of the program you want to run. For example, to run `Program1.java`, enter `Program1` into the prompt. 


## Committing Your Code
If you can't commit and push, be sure to set your git config settings
```
git config --global user.name yourGithubUsername
git config --global user.email yourGithubAccountEmail
```
